            <h1>The Era</h1>
        <p>The following list of artists and architects who flourished in the 17th century is organized alphabetically by country of origin or residence. With a few exceptions, the work of these artists falls into either the Baroque or the Classical style, though sometimes both  Baroque art is generally recognized by its emotional qualities, its moodiness, grandeur, vitality, and complexity, whereas Classical art betrays the influence of the art of antiquity, emphasizing harmony, restraint, and clarity. In the 17th century Classicism was most prevalent in France and England, whereas Baroque held sway in Italy, Spain, and northern Europe, where artists were also practicing a Baroque style mixed with a new sense of realism and naturalism.</p>
