                 <p>Van Gogh's unique life has inspired millions to become active in art. In fact, what many people today consider to be the archetypical "artist persona" is largely a result of his influence. Perhaps the most impressive aspect is that artists continue to mimic the style that Van Gogh created over one hundred years ago. In the 17th century Classicism was most prevalent in France and England, whereas Baroque held sway in Italy, Spain, and northern Europe, where artists were also practicing a Baroque style mixed with a new sense of realism and naturalism. </p>
